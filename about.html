      <h3> Origin & Distribution </h3>
      <p class="info-text"> The hot drink made from the roasted beans established itself very early on in the Arab world. At the beginning of the 17th century, seafaring traders brought coffee to Europe and it was first served in coffee houses in the big cities. Due to the scarce supply, coffee was initially seen as a luxury good that only a suitably wealthy clientele could afford.
It was only through increasing industrialization and more efficient production that coffee became affordable for broader sections of the population in the 19th century. </p>

      <h3>The cultivation of coffee </h3>
      <p class="info-text">The cultivation of coffee requires certain climatic conditions, which are particularly present along the equator. The tropical climate in particular favors the growth of the evergreen coffee plant in the areas also known as the coffee belt. From this point of view, South America plays a special role as a coffee exporter.

      <h3> Processing and production of coffee</h3>
      <p class="info-text">The so-called coffee cherries, each containing two coffee beans as a core, need about ten months until they are ripe and can be harvested. On many plantations, the harvest is as complex as a grape harvest:
With the so-called picking method, only the fully ripened cherries are picked by hand.
If, on the other hand, machines are used, stripping is used, in which all the fruits of a predominantly ripe branch are removed and collected for further processing. </p>

      <h3> Harvest</h3>
      <p class="info-text">Before the coffee beans can be processed, they must be separated from the pulp of the cherry. Basically, two different methods are used here. The processing method can affect the flavor of the beans.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Dry processing:</strong>
<br>
The harvested coffee cherries are exposed to direct sunlight over large areas for several weeks and are turned from time to time. The pulp is then mechanically separated and the beans are cleaned and packaged for export.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Wet processing:</strong>
<br>
Only crops obtained by the picking method can be used for wet processing, which requires large amounts of water. The cherries are sorted by size and stored overnight in so-called spring tanks. They are then peeled by machine. The beans are then returned to large tanks for so-called fermentation, where enzymes are added to them. The beans are thoroughly washed for further processing. </p> 
    </div>
    <div class="grid-text-item item9">
      <h3> Roasting of the beans</h3>
      <p class="info-text">In most cases, the roasting is carried out in the importing country. The beans are kept in motion throughout the process to ensure even roasting. Yes, the roasting is important for the aroma development of the beans. The heat during processing ensures that the acids contained in the beans are broken down and the liquid content is reduced. Up to 800 different aromas are released through the process.
